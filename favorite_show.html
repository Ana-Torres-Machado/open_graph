            </center>
            <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: white">It is <strong>the end of the Clone Wars, Order 66 has happened</strong>. After over half of a year being away from base, Clone Force 99 returns to Kamino. The squad itself is composed of five different soldiers.
                 Hunter is the leader and can sense magnetic fields from droids, Tech is a genius, Wrecker is extremely strong, Crosshair can see things from far away and has excellent aim, and Echo is a cyborg. However, their life is brought upside down once there is betrayal amongst 
                 themselves. Along the way, they find Omega, who looks like a normal kid in hindsight, but has a secret not even she knows. Now, the clones will be out on their own as they try to escape the Empire and come to the realization that they are not the soldiers they once were, 
                 and that things will change forever for them.
            </p>

            <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: white">
                I personally adored this show. It indirectly gave important lessons about judgement and that not everything is what it seems. The story was well written, they included well-known characters for
                those who have seen Star Wars for a long time now, and the voice acting is amazing! And the scenes were so well written it was like, despite most characters wearing helmets, you could imagine their
                facial expressions. You could remain engaged and binge for the longest time. I personally binged from 7-10 episodes in one sitting, and that says something since I'm rather restless.

                <h3 style="color:white">HUNTER</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white">CT-9901, otherwise known as Hunter, is the leader of the Bad Batch. While stoic and firm, it is no secret that he cares about his squad.
                    With a vibroblade by his side and his enganced skill of heightened senses, he can certainly pack quite the punch, despite being 5'11" (1.80 m). He keeps the team working along and knows when to 
                    keep them out of danger's way.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">TECH</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white"> CT-9902, or "Tech", is the brains of the Bad Batch. He may be booksmart, but he's not quite experienced in social cues and, according 
                    to Hunter in the show The Clone Wars, "Tech will dump you useless information for hours". Regardless of that fact and the ocassional snark, he is still a team player and will try his best to 
                    understand the situation at hand, including Wrecker's antics.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">WRECKER</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white"> Wrecker, CT-9903(not confirmed), is the brawn and comedic relief of the team. He may seem like he has an empty head, but he has a heart
                    of gold. In my opinion, he is the glue that keeps the squad together.
