            </center>
            <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: white">It is <strong>the end of the Clone Wars, Order 66 has happened</strong>. After over half of a year being away from base, Clone Force 99 returns to Kamino. The squad itself is composed of five different soldiers.
                 Hunter is the leader and can sense magnetic fields from droids, Tech is a genius, Wrecker is extremely strong, Crosshair can see things from far away and has excellent aim, and Echo is a cyborg. However, their life is brought upside down once there is betrayal amongst 
                 themselves. Along the way, they find Omega, who looks like a normal kid in hindsight, but has a secret not even she knows. Now, the clones will be out on their own as they try to escape the Empire and come to the realization that they are not the soldiers they once were, 
                 and that things will change forever for them.
            </p>

            <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: white">
                I personally adored this show. It indirectly gave important lessons about judgement and that not everything is what it seems. The story was well written, they included well-known characters for
                those who have seen Star Wars for a long time now, and the voice acting is amazing! And the scenes were so well written it was like, despite most characters wearing helmets, you could imagine their
                facial expressions. You could remain engaged and binge for the longest time. I personally binged from 7-10 episodes in one sitting, and that says something since I'm rather restless.

                <h3 style="color:white">HUNTER</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white">CT-9901, otherwise known as Hunter, is the sergeant and leader of the Bad Batch. While stoic and firm, it is no secret that he cares about his squad.
                    With a vibroblade by his side and his enganced skill of heightened senses, he can certainly pack quite the punch, despite being 5'11" (1.80 m). He keeps the team working along and knows when to 
                    keep them out of danger's way.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">TECH</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white"> CT-9902, or "Tech", is the brains of the Bad Batch. He may be booksmart, but he's not quite experienced in social cues and, according 
                    to Hunter in the show The Clone Wars, "Tech will dump you useless information for hours". Regardless of that fact and the ocassional snark, he is still a team player and will try his best to 
                    understand the situation at hand, including Wrecker's antics.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">WRECKER</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white"> Wrecker, CT-9903(not confirmed), is the brawn and comedic relief of the team. He may seem like he has an empty head, but he has a heart
                    of gold. In my opinion, he is the glue that keeps the squad together. He has an obession with food and things that go boom, as quoted in the Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia, "the bigger the bang,
                    the happier he is".
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">CROSSHAIR</h3>
                    <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white"> CT-9904, commonly referred to as "Crosshair", is the Bad Batch's marksman. He was modified to see kilometers away to hit a target with his sniper,
                        the 773 Firepuncher, which is a common favorite among Republic-grade snipers. He may have an icy personality, and even be a bit cynical, but he still will protect those he's allied with. Even
                        when the cost could be an arm or a leg.
                    </p>
                <h3 style="color:white;">ECHO</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white">
                    Echo, or CT-1409, is a former ARC Trooper of the 501st, a squad of clones led by Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. After being promoted to the rank of an ARC trooper, he is set out to Lola Sayu, where
                    he is believed to be killed by an explosion. After further research, it is discovered that he is actually alive and his knowledge is being used against the Republic. After his rescue, he doesn't feel
                    he still belongs with the 501st, and Hunter gives him the offer to join their squad of "aberrant clone commandos" (Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia), which soon Echo accepts. He now fights with new honor
                    and brings his ARC skills to the table.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:white">OMEGA</h3>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:white">
                    Omega is a special case from the other clones. Female and unmodified, she lives like an average teenage girl on Kamino as Nala Se's assistant. During the first episode of the series, titled "Aftermath",
                    it is easy to deduce that she has been watching the Bad Batch for a while now. After she tells the Batchers about the existence of inhibitor chips, which are the devices that Palpatine used in order to 
                    execute Order 66, she and the Bad Batch escape before they get injured or worse, but not without facing betrayal as well.
