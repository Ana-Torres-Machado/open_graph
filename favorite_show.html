            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>It is the end of the Clone Wars, Order 66 has happened. After over half of a year being away from base, Clone Force 99 returns to Kamino. The squad itself is composed of five different soldiers.
                 Hunter is the leader and can sense magnetic fields from droids, Tech is a genius, Wrecker is extremely strong, Crosshair can see things from far away and has excellent aim, and Echo is a cyborg.
                However, their life is brought upside down once there is betrayal amongst themselves. Along the way, they find Omega, who looks like a normal kid in hindsight, but has a secret not even she knows.
                Now, the clones will be out on their own as they try to escape the Empire and come to the realization that they are not the soldiers they once were, and that things will change forever for them.

            <p>
                I personally adored this show. It indirectly gave important lessons about judgement and that not everything is what it seems. The story was well written, they included well-known characters for
                those who have seen Star Wars for a long time now, and the voice acting is amazing! And the scenes were so well written it was like, despite most characters wearing helmets, you could imagine their
                facial expressions. You could remain engaged and binge for the longest time. I personally binged from 7-10 episodes in one sitting, and that says something since I'm rather restless.
